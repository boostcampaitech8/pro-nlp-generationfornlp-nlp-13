       "      <td>For the poet Phillis Wheatley, who was brought to colonial New England as a slave in 1761, the formal literary code of eighteenth-century English was thrice removed: by the initial barrier of the unfamiliar English language, by the discrepancy between spoken and literary forms of English, and by the African tradition of oral rather than written verbal art. Wheatley transcended these barriers—she learned the English language and English literary forms so quickly and well that she was composing good poetry in English within a few years of her arrival in New England. Wheatley's experience exemplifies the meeting of oral and written literary cultures. The aesthetic principles of the African oral tradition were preserved in America by folk artists in work songs, dancing, field hollers, religious music, the use of the drum, and, after the drum was forbidden, in the perpetuation of drum effects in song. African languages and the functions of language in African societies not only contributed to the emergence of a distinctive Black English but also exerted demonstrable effects on the manner in which other Americans spoke English. Given her African heritage and her facility with English and the conventions of English poetry, Wheatley's work had the potential to apply the ideas of a written literature to an oral literary tradition in the creation of an African American literary language. But this was a potential that her poetry unfortunately did not exploit. The standards of eighteenth-century English poetry, which itself reflected little of the American language, led Wheatley to develop a notion of poetry as a closed system, derived from imitation of earlier written works. No place existed for the rough-and-ready Americanized English she heard in the streets, for the English spoken by Black people, or for Africanisms. The conventions of eighteenth-century neoclassical poetry ruled out casual talk; her voice and feelings had to be generalized according to rules of poetic diction and characterization; the particulars of her African past, if they were to be dealt with at all, had to be subordinated to the reigning conventions. African poetry did not count as poetry in her new situation, and African aesthetic canons were irrelevant to the new context because no linguistic or social framework existed to reinforce them. Wheatley adopted a foreign language and a foreign literary tradition; they were not extensions of her past experience, but replacements. Thus limited by the eighteenth-century English literary code, Wheatley's poetry contributed little to the development of a distinctive African American literary language.

Wheatley transcended these barriers—she learned the English language and English literary forms so quickly and well that she was composing good poetry in English within a few years of her arrival in New England. Wheatley's experience exemplifies the meeting of oral and written literary cultures. The aesthetic principles of the African oral tradition were preserved in America by folk artists in work songs, dancing, field hollers, religious music, the use of the drum, and, after the drum was forbidden, in the perpetuation of drum effects in song. African languages and the functions of language in African societies not only contributed to the emergence of a distinctive Black English but also exerted demonstrable effects on the manner in which other Americans spoke English. Given her African heritage and her facility with English and the conventions of English poetry, Wheatley's work had the potential to apply the ideas of a written literature to an oral literary tradition in the creation of an African American literary language. But this was a potential that her poetry unfortunately did not exploit. The standards of eighteenth-century English poetry, which itself reflected little of the American language, led Wheatley to develop a notion of poetry as a closed system, derived from imitation of earlier written works. No place existed for the rough-and-ready Americanized English she heard in the streets, for the English spoken by Black people, or for Africanisms. The conventions of eighteenth-century neoclassical poetry ruled out casual talk; her voice and feelings had to be generalized according to rules of poetic diction and characterization; the particulars of her African past, if they were to be dealt with at all, had to be subordinated to the reigning conventions.

       "9   One scientific discipline, during its early stages of development, is often related to another as an antithesis to its thesis. The thesis discipline tends to concern itself with discovery and classification of phenomena, to offer holistic explanations emphasizing pattern and form, and to use existing theory to explain the widest possible range of phenomena.

       "'1761년 식민지 뉴잉글랜드에 노예로 끌려온 시인 필리스 휘틀리에게 18세기 영어의 형식적 문학 규범은 세 번이나 차단되었다. 처음에는 낯선 영어라는 언어 장벽이 있었고, 그 다음에는 구어체와 문어체 영어의 불일치가 있었으며, 마지막으로는 구술 예술이라는 아프리카 전통이 있었다. 휘틀리는 이러한 장벽을 초월하였다. 그녀는 영어와 영어 문학 형식을 매우 빠르고 잘 배워 뉴잉글랜드에 도착한 지 몇 년 만에 영어로 훌륭한 시를 작곡하였다. 휘틀리의 경험은 구술 문학 문화와 문서 문학 문화의 만남을 잘 보여준다. 아프리카 구술 전통의 미적 원칙은 미국에서 민속 예술가들에 의해 작업 노래, 춤, 들판의 외침, 종교 음악, 드럼의 사용, 그리고 드럼이 금지된 이후에는 노래에서 드럼 효과의 지속을 통해 보존되었다. 아프리카 언어와 아프리카 사회에서의 언어 기능은 독특한 흑인 영어의 출현에 기여했을 뿐만 아니라 다른 미국인들이 영어를 구사하는 방식에도 뚜렷한 영향을 미쳤다. 그녀의 아프리카 유산과 영어 및 영어 시의 관습에 대한 능력을 고려할 때, 휘틀리의 작품은 구술 문학 전통에 서면 문학의 아이디어를 적용할 잠재력을 가지고 있었다. 그러나 불행히도 그녀의 시는 이러한 잠재력을 활용하지 못하였다. 18세기 영어 시의 기준은 미국 언어를 거의 반영하지 않았고, 이는 휘틀리로 하여금 이전의 서면 작품을 모방하여 파생된 폐쇄적인 시 개념을 발전시키게 하였다. 그녀가 거리에서 들었던 거칠고 즉흥적인 미국식 영어, 흑인들이 사용하는 영어, 아프리카적 요소들은 그 자리에 존재하지 않았다. 18세기 신고전주의 시의 규범은 일상적인 대화를 배제하였고, 그녀의 목소리와 감정은 시적 어휘와 특성화의 규칙에 따라 일반화되어야 했다. 그녀의 아프리카 과거의 구체적인 요소들은 다루어지더라도 지배적인 규범에 종속되어야 했다. 아프리카 시는 그녀의 새로운 상황에서 시로 간주되지 않았고, 아프리카 미적 기준은 새로운 맥락에서 무의미하였다. 왜냐하면 이를 강화할 언어적 또는 사회적 틀이 존재하지 않았기 때문이다. 휘틀리는 외국어와 외국 문학 전통을 채택하였고, 이는 그녀의 과거 경험의 연장이 아니라 대체물이었다. 따라서 18세기 영어 문학 규범에 의해 제한된 휘틀리의 시는 독특한 아프리카 미국 문학 언어의 발전에 거의 기여하지 못하였다. 그럼에도 불구하고 그녀가 선택한 문학적 관습의 기준에 따르면 휘틀리의 시는 부인할 수 없이 뛰어난 성과를 이루었으며, 그녀는 첫 번째 흑인 미국 시인으로서 정당하게 기념받고 있다.'"

       "(\"For the poet Phillis Wheatley, who was brought to colonial New England as a slave in 1761, the formal literary code of eighteenth-century English was thrice removed: by the initial barrier of the unfamiliar English language, by the discrepancy between spoken and literary forms of English, and by the African tradition of oral rather than written verbal art. Wheatley transcended these barriers—she learned the English language and English literary forms so quickly and well that she was composing good poetry in English within a few years of her arrival in New England. Wheatley's experience exemplifies the meeting of oral and written literary cultures. The aesthetic principles of the African oral tradition were preserved in America by folk artists in work songs, dancing, field hollers, religious music, the use of the drum, and, after the drum was forbidden, in the perpetuation of drum effects in song. African languages and the functions of language in African societies not only contributed to the emergence of a distinctive Black English but also exerted demonstrable effects on the manner in which other Americans spoke English. Given her African heritage and her facility with English and the conventions of English poetry, Wheatley's work had the potential to apply the ideas of a written literature to an oral literary tradition in the creation of an African American literary language. But this was a potential that her poetry unfortunately did not exploit. The standards of eighteenth-century English poetry, which itself reflected little of the American language, led Wheatley to develop a notion of poetry as a closed system, derived from imitation of earlier written works. No place existed for the rough-and-ready Americanized English she heard in the streets, for the English spoken by Black people, or for Africanisms. The conventions of eighteenth-century neoclassical poetry ruled out casual talk; her voice and feelings had to be generalized according to rules of poetic diction and characterization; the particulars of her African past, if they were to be dealt with at all, had to be subordinated to the reigning conventions. African poetry did not count as poetry in her new situation, and African aesthetic canons were irrelevant to the new context because no linguistic or social framework existed to reinforce them. Wheatley adopted a foreign language and a foreign literary tradition; they were not extensions of her past experience, but replacements. Thus limited by the eighteenth-century English literary code, Wheatley's poetry contributed little to the development of a distinctive African American literary language. Yet by the standards of the literary conventions in which she chose to work, Wheatley's poetry is undeniably accomplished, and she is justly celebrated as the first Black American poet.\",\n",
